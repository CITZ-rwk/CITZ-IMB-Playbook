### BC DevExchange Adoption Pattern
#### The Need:
Modernization has been identified as a Ministry goal. To achieve this business units are embarking on  difficult change initiatives that are tied to culture shifts within their organizations. It won’t happen overnight. Readiness to adopt new systems and approaches requires a plan. A key element of the plan is based on having the capabilities and capacity to deliver solutions that end-users value. The [BC DevExchange](https://bcdevexchange.org/){:target="_blank"} is an incubator for the promotion of  innovation.

#### User Story:
As a member of the business unit executive, I need to have a knowledgeable team capable of delivering a digitally enabled product that meets the needs of our discerning users.

#### Context:
Taking a solution that is nearing it’s end of life, identifying business scenarios through client engagement can identify the need to create internal capacity for team skills capable of proposing, designing and delivering solutions that will modernize the business unit’s product portfolio for the digital government era. 

#### Scenario:
The BCDev Exchange promotes the creation of organizational capabilities that allow teams to solve difficult business problems. The [lab environment](https://bcdevexchange.org/ExchangeLab){:target="_blank"} offers teams space where they can reside for up to a year (physically or virtually), be exposed to resident experts that have experience and knowledge in delivering solutions based on agile methodologies and using open source software working on modern cloud-ready platforms.

#### Solution:
-	Obtain executive sponsorship and commitment to form a dedicated team to [learn](https://bcdevexchange.org/learning){:target="_blank"}, experiment and create a viable solution in the BC Dev Exchange lab environment capable of being transitioned to and  supported by the IMB.   
-	Start the conversation with the IMB Strategic planning team.

### Microsoft SharePoint Adoption Pattern
#### The Need:
Collaboration is key to team success. Working in the open is a digital principle that requires on-demand access to information. Projects are mandated to follow core policy and OCIO records management. Files stored on network drives or in e-Mail folders are difficult to locate. A purpose built, secure (IDIR/BCeID supported) document repository enforces structure and file findability.  

#### User Story:
As a member of the business unit working on a new initiative, I need to have a secure document storage site that my team and our partners can access over the web so that we can collaborate on documents for our project.

#### Context:
Teams delivering a time boxed initiative create office documents of many common types including spreadsheets, presentations, word and PDF documents. Being able to organize the document structure allows for efficient team collaboration. 

#### Scenario:
Your initiative requires a central repository of project related documents, lists and team contacts. Files should only be viewable to those who have been granted access to specific folders. In order to ensure that changes can be rolled back a versioning feature is required. The platform should include an all-of-site search capability. The site will have a diverse set of government users but may also allow access to external authenticated users.

#### Solution:
Before deciding on a completely self serve approach to team based document management engage the IMB SharePoint consulting services team who will examine your requirements and guide site design, configuration and development. SharePoint is a flexible environment and includes a team site collaboration template.

### BC Dev Exchange DevOps Container Platform(OpenShift) Adoption Pattern
#### The Need:
Successful application development teams require on-demand, consistent environments and do not want to deal with underlying infrastructure. Business units are looking for hosting flexibility.

#### User Story:
As a product owner, I need to be assured that my  full stack development team has access to a supported platform that offers an automated code delivery environment without having to concern ourselves about the infrastructure so that my team can sustain a high frequency of feature delivery.

#### Context:
As teams design and architect new IT based systems that deliver business value they are looking to adopt flexible technologies without the inherent lock-in that have come with selecting platforms in the past. Application containers are lightweight, secure and scalable. Container Based Applications (CBA) are portable across a number of on-premise (OCIO-ES) and vendor clouds. 

#### Scenarios:
-	New or existing web based solutions that can be designed or refactored to run on the OpenShift platform.
-	 New product offerings that may have peak volume demands are ideal candidates to take advantage of the scalable nature of the [BCDevExchange DevOps](https://bcdevexchange.org/DevOpsPlatform){:target="_blank"} OpenShift container platform. 
-	ETL scheduled jobs.
-	 Application Programming Interfaces (API). 
-	Solutions that don’t expect to have a high degree of ongoing development.    

#### Solution:
-	Obtain executive approval as described in the DevExchange Adoption Pattern(LINK). 
-	Identify a Product Owner and a Technical Steward for your project.
-	Communicate with the DevExchange DevOps team through [Rocketchat](https://chat.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/home){:target="_blank"}.
-	Request a [GitHub repository](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Getting-Started-on-the-DevOps-Platform/How-to-request-new-GitHub-user-access-or-repository-creation){:target="_blank"}.
-	Request an [OpenShift environment](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Getting-Started-on-the-DevOps-Platform/How-to-Request-a-New-OpenShift-Project){:target="_blank"}.
