This playbook is designed to help you on your IT project journey. It provides you with a collection of references to tested methodologies, tools and best practices.  Developing and supporting government applications continues to shift from a requirements heavy traditional [waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) methodology towards a user centric agile approach with shorter project development cycles and the adoption of a [DevOps](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/devops-process-flow) culture that has been successfully pioneered within the BC Government by the [BC Dev Exchange](https://bcdevexchange.org/).

### 1: Ideate solutions that meet the needs of business
The business knows its users, it owns the problem space. Apply design thinking to new product development to create high value solutions that users want to adopt.

### 6: Continuous Product Improvement
In this play, a team is responsible for a continuous cycle of product enhancement and ongoing support based on incorporating user feedback and operational metrics provided by monitoring.  The product owner shifts their role to becoming the “story owner”.
<br/>
[Play 6](/CITZ-IMB-playbook/play6)

### 7: Sustainment Lifecycle
Your product has been delivered and you have a product roadmap that guides your products lifecycle.

You need to ensure you revisit your plan to ensure the annual funding is in place to account for any and all changes including product retirement and product replacement.

## Definition of a Modern Application
A modern application is one that exhibits five important characteristics:
1. It supports multiple users through the interface of their choice.
  - Web, Mobile, API (application programming interface).
2. It provides an API for accessing data over [HTTP(S)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) for all features that would normally be available over a graphical user interface (GUI) or the command line interface (CLI).
3. Its data is available via generic formats (such as [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) or XML).
4. It is built on a modern stack that supports the creation of an application with a HTTP interface and an API which can consume and emit JSON data.
5. It conforms to the relevant elements of a [12-factor](https://12factor.net/) application.
