This playbook is designed to help you on your IT project journey. It provides the reader with a collection of references to tested methodologies, tools and best practices.  Developing and supporting government applications continues to shift from a requirements heavy traditional [waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) methodology towards a user centric agile approach with shorter project development cycles and the adoption of a [DevOps](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/devops-process-flow) culture that has been successfully pioneered within the BC Government by the [BC Dev Exchange](https://bcdevexchange.org/).  

## What does it do?
Contributes to a shared understanding of the solution ecosystem from ideation to sustained operating IM/IT systems. “Plays” describe valuable patterns that project teams should consider as part of their modern digital product management lifecycle. 

## What are the Benefits?
Provides the IMB and our partners, vendors and clients with key resources that will assist them to identify, use and leverage trustworthy sources of knowledge that is regularly improved with the aim of enhancing and simplifying the IT solution delivery experience. 

## The Plays...

### 1: Ideate solutions that meet the needs of business
The business knows its users, it owns the problem space. Apply design thinking to new product development to create high value solutions that users want to adopt.

### 2: Successfully navigate the project intake process
Having a clear understanding of the IM/IT project governance process will ensure your proposal can obtain the necessary approvals in order to proceed.

### 3: Getting started to develop your solution
Develop your team’s capacity to deliver modern digital solutions by enhancing your existing skillset through exposure to experienced people.

[Play 3](/CITZ-IMB-playbook/play3)

### 4: Developing a product
Methodologies and frameworks that result in working MVP solutions that have built in security and are designed for operations.                                                                                     
[Play 4](/CITZ-IMB-playbook/play4)

### 5: Transition to Ops
Following a successful initial product development and deployment a Digital Product is launched. At this stage a decision is made  concerning the products lifecycle. Following  a knowledge transfer from the development team the product can be transitioned to operations.
<br/>
[Play 5](/CITZ-IMB-playbook/play5)

### 6: Continuous Product Improvement
In this cycle a team is responsible for a continuous cycle of product enhancement and ongoing support based on incorporating user feedback and operational metrics provided by monitoring.  The product owner shifts their role to becoming the “story owner”.
<br/>
[Play 6](/CITZ-IMB-playbook/play6)

### 7: Sustainment Lifecycle
Your product has been delivered you have a product roadmap that guides the product lifecycle.

You need to ensure you revisit your plan to ensure the annual funding is in place to account for any and all changes including product retirement and product replacement.

## Definition of a Modern Application
Is an application that exhibits five important characteristics:
1. Supports multiple users through the interface of their choice
  - Web, Mobile, API (application programming interface)
2.	Provides an API for accessing data over [HTTP(S)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) for all features that would normally be available over a graphical user interface (GUI) or the command line interface (CLI)
3.	Data is available via generic formats (such as [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) or XML)
4.	Is built on a modern stack that supports the creation of an application with a HTTP interface and an API which can consume and emit JSON data
5.	Conforms to the relevant elements of a [12-factor](https://12factor.net/) application
