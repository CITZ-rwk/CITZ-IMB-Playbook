## Successfully Navigate the Project Intake Process
To improve the delivery of successful IM/IT services that meet Ministry goals and objectives, business units work with experienced senior business consultants. Following the Ministry IM/IT Governance process ensures that project proposals, which have been championed by a Ministry business unit, will obtain funding and approvals for strategically important initiatives.

### Step 1: Obtain Business Unit Endorsement
- Follow your business unit's project authorization process
    - Create a Concept Case / Business Case
    - Receive approval to proceed
    - The business unit's analyst works closely with the Project Secretariat Senior Business Consultant (SBC) and holds biweekly meetings to surface initiatives and concerns
    - Register proposal in the Ministry project tracking system
- Develop your operating model
  - What does it mean to be "done"?
  - Who will maintain and operate the solution?
  - What is the [sustainment lifecycle](/CITZ-IMB-playbook/play7) for the product?

### Step 2: Follow the Ministry IM/IT Project Intake Process
- Submit a project intake form
    - The IM/IT Project Coordinator works with the SBC to ensure the submission receives visibility
    - Provide project summary information
    - Complete a client project survey in order to rank the submission
- Provide resources to participate at the Architecture Review Board(ARB)
    - The ARB assesses the submission to determine technical fit with Government CIO / Ministry CIO direction
    - The Project Review Board (PRAB) conducts a project review
        - Upon approval to proceed, a project charter will be required
        - Project submission will be made to the OCIO-Digital Investment Office and authorized by the Deputy Minister Committee

### Step 3: Determine Project Resourcing
- For an internally managed initiative:
    - The business unit has the skillset and resources to successfully manage and deliver the project
    - The business unit enters a procurement activity to obtain an IM/IT solution via a Request For Proposal (RFP) process.
- For a partnership agreement
    - The business unit enters into an Alliance agreement with the BCDevExchange and OCIO-Digital Products Division (DPDD) to design and develop a solution -*or*-
    - The business unit enters into a “Memorandum of Understanding” (MOU) with the IMB to co-develop and deliver an IM/IT solution
      - Incorporate a transition plan section into your MOU
      - Formulate a common understanding of the "definition of done"
    - **NOTE:** It takes time to resource additional skills (often as long as 6 months), so plan accordingly in your transition plan -*or*-
    - Draw down on Ministry contract for an external vendor via the IMB's Request for Service (RFS) process

### Step 4: Provide Regular Updates 
- This is based upon the reporting requirement
  - IM/IT capital = quarterly
  - Project reporting = monthly
- Working with the Secretariat Portfolio Manager / Project Analyst, provide regular status updates to Ministry executives

### Resources

- The [Architecture Review Board](https://cio.ubc.ca/it-governance/governance-body-responsibilities/architecture-review-board){:target="_blank"} should be aware of your project and may ask you to provide a presentation
- Understand why [Governance](http://www.optimumonline.ca/pdf/29-2/governance.pdf){:target="_blank"} is important
- Adhere to Government IM/IT Principles and Standards
