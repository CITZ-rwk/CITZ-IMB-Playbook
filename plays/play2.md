## Successfully navigate the Project Intake Process
To improve our ability to deliver successful IM/IT services that meet the Ministry goals and objectives, business units work with experienced senior business consultants. Following the Ministry IM/IT Governance process ensures that project proposals that have been championed by a Ministry business unit will obtain funding and approvals for strategically important initiatives.

### Step 1: Obtain Business Unit endorsement
- Follow change management best practices.
- Follow your business unit's project authorization process.
    - Create a Concept Case/Business Case.
    - Receive approval to proceed.
    - Business unit's analyst works closely with the Project Secretariat Senior Business Consultant (SBC), holds regular biweekly meetings to surface initiatives and concerns.
    - Register proposal in the Ministry project tracking system.
- Develop your operating model.
  - What does it mean to be ‘done’?
  - Who will maintain and operate the solution?
  - What is the sustainment lifecycle for the product? (Skip ahead and go to [Play 7](/CITZ-IMB-playbook/play7) now.)

### Step 2: Follow the Ministry IM-IT project intake process
- Submit project Intake Form.
    - IM/IT Project Coordinator works with SBC to ensure submission receives visibility.
    - Provide project summary information.
    - Complete client project survey in order to rank submission.
- Provide resources to participate at the Architecture Review Board(ARB).
    - ARB assesses submission to determine technical fit with Government CIO/Ministry CIO direction.
    - Project review by the Project Review Board (PRAB).
        - Upon approval to proceed a project charter will be required.
        - Project submission will be made to the OCIO-Digital Investment Office and authorized by the Deputy Minister Committee.

### Step 3: Determine Project Resourcing
- Internally managed initiative.
    - Business Unit has the skillset and resources to successfully manage and deliver the project.
    - Business Unit enters a procurement activity to obtain an IM/IT solution via a Request For Proposal (RFP) process.
- Partnership Agreement.
    - Business Unit enters into an Alliance agreement with the BCDevExchange/OCIO-Digital Products Division (DPDD) to design and develop a solution -*or*-
    - Business Unit enters a “Memorandum of Understanding” (MOU) with the IMB to co-develop and deliver an IM/IT solution.
      - Incorporate a transition plan section into your MOU.
      - Formulate a common understanding of the ‘definition of done’.
    - **NOTE:** It takes time to resource additional skills, often as long as 6 months, plan accordingly in your transition plan -*or*-
    - Draw down on Ministry contract for an external vendor via the IMB's Request for Service (RFS) process.

### Step 4: Provide regular updates 
- Based upon the reporting requirement.
  - IM/IT capital = quarterly.
  - Project reporting = monthly.
- Working with the Secretariat Portfolio Manager / Project Analyst provide regular status update to  Ministry executives.

### Resources
The CITZ IMB maintains a collection of templates and information in their [Project Management Resource Centre](https://intranet.gov.bc.ca/thehub/tools-and-resources/project-management-resource-centre). Gaurav Mehra provides insight into common challenges encountered in Agile intake processes: [Part 1](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/agile-project-intake-challenges-learnings-best-practices-gaurav-mehra?articleId=6418711210946101248) & [Part 2](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/introduction-agile-project-intake-challenges-learnings-gaurav-mehra)

### Guidance to consider
Broad examples include:
- Understand the [Work Intake Process](https://acuityppm.com/ppm-101-successful-work-intake-process/).
- [Architecture Review Board](https://cio.ubc.ca/it-governance/governance-body-responsibilities/architecture-review-board) should be aware of your project and may ask you to provide a presentation.
- Understand why [Governance](http://www.optimumonline.ca/pdf/29-2/governance.pdf) is important.
- Adhere to Government IM/IT Principles and Standards.
