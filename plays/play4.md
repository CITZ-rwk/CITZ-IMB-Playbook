## Ready, Refine, Sprint...
Activities undertaken by the entire team to define a fulsome “sprint 0”  prepare the team for product development sprints.  

Adopt code frameworks and libraries that accelerate your development to create working Minimal Viable Product (MVP) solutions that adhere to security and privacy requirements.

Define your architecturally significant requirements (ASR) based on product abilities. Implement architecture as late as possible so as to be able to pivot when required.

### Step 1: Develop a release plan
-	Refine the (initial) backlog.
-	Define the product release schedule.
-	Develop/review feature stories.
-	Identify dependencies.

### Step 2: Develop your conceptual architecture
- Whiteboard relationships between components and the data model.
- Document the overarching view of the system (placement of technical functions (e.g. use ArchiMate to visualize relationships).

### Step 3: Adhere to modern application principles
-	Adopt the [12 factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-Factor_App_methodology){:target="_blank"} approach
-	Understand cloud native architecture

### Step 4: Set up your environment (technical infrastructure)
*What are the prescriptive patterns to get you started?*
- Access to development environments
- Communication channels for support (e.g.: MS-Teams, RocketChat, Slack)

### Step 5: Identify your development workflow processes

### Step 6: Set up, document &  implement your tooling (code repository, pipelines, automation)
Verify your  processes for successful:
- Integration
- Build and Deployment
- Application Security

### Step 7: Educate your business stakeholders
Your project has a finite set of resources and funding, defining and managing the scope is critical to your team’s success. The product owner has to educate both the team and the stakeholders in order to manage the team’s velocity and output. 
-	Keep an eye on the budget.
-	Ensure change management processes are being followed.
-	Regularly groom the backlog.

### Step 8: Now Sprint...
Following a successful “Sprint 0” phase your team is prepared to start coding, testing and committing features into the source code management system.
- (Where it makes sense…) adopt a Test Driven Development](TDD) approach to coding.

### Step 9: Conduct code reviews (as required)
-	Automate where possible.

### Step 10: Complete User Acceptance testing and remediate defects

### Step 11: Deploy, promote through your environments
- Product Owner (PO) confirms the [Definition of Done](https://www.scrum.org/forum/scrum-forum/5438/product-owner-and-definition-done){:target="_blank"} (DoD) prior to deployment.

### Step 12: Demonstrate your products frequently, obtain user feedback 
- Sprint demos (feature delivery)
- Stakeholder demo (batch delivery)

### Step 13: Monitor and measure the development process
- Supports Product Owner and supports the Team – shields members from scope/feature creep
- [Monitor your system for reliability](https://aspetraining.com/resources/blog/system-monitoring-age-of-site-reliability-engineering){:target="_blank"}

### Definition of an MVP:
A Minimal Viable Product (MVP) is one that delivers  core functionality as expected by a business units’ target audience. The core functionality is a set of features that is delivered at the initial product  launch.  Once launched the product follows a documented lifecycle for user feedback and product support.

An MVP is no longer considered to be an experiment, but a product that has value to its users.

### Guidance to consider
-	Understand how product management is different in Agile projects.
-	Understand agile software product integrity.
-	Define and develop your pipeline (ex: Jenkins).
-	Create and maintain a testing framework.
