## Develop your Product
Adopt code frameworks that accelerate your development to create working Minimal Viable Product (MVP) solutions which have built in security and are designed for [product management](https://www.infoq.com/articles/product-management-in-agile/). 

Define your [architecturally significant requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecturally_significant_requirements#:~:text=Architecturally%20significant%20requirements%20are%20those,system%20in%20measurably%20identifiable%20ways.) (ASR) based on  product “abilities”:	
- Deployability
- Modifiability
- Testability 
- Monitorability

### Step 1: Meet with your team
- Establish a [team agreement](https://shift.newco.co/2017/07/23/team-working-agreements-the-why-what-and-how/#:~:text=Why%20is%20it%20important%3F,together%20to%20produce%20great%20results.)

### Step 2: Design / describe your Solution (conceptual architecture) 
- Whiteboarding – relationships between components, data model
- Skeletal framework – overarching view of the system (placement of function technical ex:  use [ArchiMate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArchiMate) to visualize relationships)

### Step 3: Adopt the [12 factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-Factor_App_methodology) approach

### Step 4: Understand ‘cloud native [architecture](https://www.infoq.com/articles/cloud-native-architecture-adoption-part1/)’

### Step 5: Set up your environment (technical infrastructure)
*What are the prescriptive patterns to get you started?*
- Access to development environments
- Communication channels for support (e.g.: MS-Teams, RocketChat, Slack)

### Step 6: Identify your [development workflow](https://doist.com/blog/design-development-workflow/)
-	Development processes  

### Step 7: Set up, document &  implement your tooling (code repository, [pipelines](https://medium.com/the-making-of-whereby/what-is-a-deployment-pipeline-and-how-it-helps-software-development-teams-6cb29917ceea), [automation](https://www.developerdotstar.com/mag/articles/automate_software_process.html))
Verify your  processes for successful:
- Integration
- Build and Deployment
- Application Security

### Step 8: Start Coding, testing  and  commit to your source code management system 
- (Where it makes sense…) adopt a [Test Driven Development](https://technologyconversations.com/2013/12/20/test-driven-development-tdd-example-walkthrough/#:~:text=Test%2Ddriven%20development%20(TDD),to%20pass%20that%20test%2C%20and) (TDD) approach to coding

### Step 9: Submit for [Code Reviews](https://www.perforce.com/blog/qac/9-best-practices-for-code-review) (as required) 

### Step 10: [Complete User Acceptance testing](https://www.smartsourcingglobal.com/user-acceptance-testing-uat-in-agile-practices/#:~:text=User%20Acceptance%20Testing%20(UAT)%20in%20Agile%20Practices,%2Dworld%20scenarios%2C%20as%20specified.) and remediate defects

### Step 11: Deploy,  promote through your environments
- Product Owner (PO) confirms the [Definition of Done](https://www.scrum.org/forum/scrum-forum/5438/product-owner-and-definition-done) (DoD) prior to deployment

### Step 12: Demonstrate your products frequently, obtain user feedback 
- [Sprint demos](https://agileforall.com/how-to-give-a-great-sprint-demo/) (feature delivery)
- [Stakeholder demo](https://medium.com/the-liberators/the-sprint-review-is-a-demo-6da8a7591d01) (batch delivery)

### Step 13: Monitor and [measure the development process](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/operations/our-insights/taking-the-measure-of-product-development)
- Supports Product Owner , supports the Team – shields members from scope/feature creep
- [Monitoring your system for reliability](https://aspetraining.com/resources/blog/system-monitoring-age-of-site-reliability-engineering)

### Definition of an MVP:
A Minimal Viable Product (MVP) is one that delivers  core functionality as expected by a business units’ target audience. The core functionality is a set of features that is delivered at the initial product  launch.  Once launched the product follows a documented lifecycle for user feedback and product support.

An MVP is no longer considered to be an experiment, but a product that has value to its users.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)

### Guidance to consider
- [Agile and Software Product Integrity](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2017/10/221329-what-can-agile-methods-bring-to-high-integrity-software-development/fulltext)
- Define and develop your Pipeline (ex: Jenkins)
- Create and maintain  a [Test Harness](https://www.guru99.com/what-is-test-harness-comparison.html)
