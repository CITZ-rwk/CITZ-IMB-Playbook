## Sustainment Lifecycle
Your product has been delivered; the product roadmap guides the product sustainment plan. Guidance described in previous plays will have produced valuable ‘lessons learned’ that should be incorporated into your products sustainment lifecycle.

Maintain care and feeding of your processes with your stakeholders through good governance.

Review annual funding plans are in place to account for any and all changes including product retirement and product replacement.

### Step 1: Maintain Happy User
-	Review your products goals and assumptions - are they still relevant?
-	Evaluate and Analyze product analytics data (if available, if not look to create it).
-	Interpret user feedback. Can unused features be deprecated? Will a new user interface result in increased adoption and user satisfaction?
-	Conduct product research. Do other products offer a better value proposition for users? 
-	Review the product roadmap and release schedule.
-	Identify new feature opportunities, can the product spawn other products?

### Step 2: Maintain product funding
-	Review your products’ value proposition.
-	Get ahead of the budget cycle, review your operating and capital expenses (OpEx/CapEx) regularly, update your budget plan often.
-	Understand opportunities to adopt non-proprietary services and products.
-	Seek reviews from the finance team.

### Step 3: Maintain vendor / partner relationships
-	Review licencing dependencies.
-	Review support arrangements.
-	Understand possible vendor roadmap impacts.

### Step 4: Continuously improve your overall lifecycle
-	The goal is continuous productivity improvement.
-	Conduct process reviews.
-	Seek, conduct and assess experiments. 

### Step 5: Maintain product integrity & quality
-	Product Owner and/or the Application Manager’s responsibility.
-	Does your release and change management processes align with the platform update cadence?
-	Review defect log. Have processes put in place reduced where on your lifecycle they are being remediated? Aim is to identify in the early development stage of [play 4](/CITZ-IMB-playbook/play4). Late stage remediation takes away from new feature development and delivery.

### Guidance to consider:
- Business Unit budgeting exercise
-	User engagement
-	UX review (outlined in [play 6](/CITZ-IMB-playbook/play6))
- Industry Analysis of similar products
- Review the corporate product inventory (look for new opportunities)
