## Building Your Team
Project success is never guaranteed. Determine your approach to product development in order to correctly fit your resource needs.  Develop your team’s capacity to deliver modern digital solutions by enhancing your existing skillset through exposure to experienced people either using temporary assignments, contractors or co-ops. Once you have your team come to a common understanding of the culture you wish to promote then entrust design and development to the team which you have empowered.

Have a design system which establishes your product framework based on your priorities and complies with government standards.

### Step 1: Go Agile, don’t repeat the old ways
- Select Agile because:
  - The intended solution is large.
  - The solution can be a collection of many different projects.
  - Working within a Time & Materials contract.
  - Requirements are expected to change over time.
  - Product Owners are embedded in a team and prepare requirements daily.
  - Projects do not have a Project Manager as all team members co-manage the project.
  - Developers have cross-functional skills. 
- Reject the ‘old ways’ (aka: Waterfall) because:
  - The intended solution will be large and has a higher risk for failure.
  - Requirements are expected to change over time.
  - Many waterfall projects are abandoned and do not meet user expectations when finally completed.

### Step 2: Augment your team with experience
- Identify the roles your project needs.
  - Build up your team's capacity by bringing in resources that are seasoned professionals. 
  - Work with the procurement team to understand how to evaluate proposals. 
  - Provide existing staff with opportunities to pair up with contractors to build more internal capability.
  - Identify the product/project owner.
  - Include a [Security](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/policies-procedures/information-security-policy-and-guidelines/role-of-miso){:target="_blank"} and Privacy Officer in your team.
- Consider the [Sprint with Us](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/marketplace/learn-more/sprint-with-us) and [Code With Us](https://engage.gov.bc.ca/data/2017/01/03/building-community-code-with-us/procurement){:target="_blank"} mechanisms that allows the Government of B.C. to procure Agile software development teams. 

### Step 3: Introduction to the Product Vision
- Review the project team membership identify responsibilities.
  - Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers, Testers.
- Specify the approval process for signing off deliverables.
- Review and understand the Product Owner's solution vision.
- Discuss the client’s attitude and approach to managing risk and change.
- Agree on a reporting strategy to track and communicate progress to stakeholders.
- Agree on which tools will foster the most productive collaboration.
- What assets are required in order to start delivering products.
- Formulate the Project Inception Agenda.

### Step 4: Project Inception 
- Identify the Scrum Master and Product Owner.
- Have a team agreement session, identify the [team’s values](http://www.andycleff.com/2015/08/agile-best-practices-values-principles-virtues/#:~:text=Agile%20Values&text=Individuals%20and%20interactions%20over%20processes,change%20over%20following%20a%20plan){:target="_blank"}. Display prominently.
- [Establish your team agreement](https://shift.newco.co/2017/07/23/team-working-agreements-the-why-what-and-how/#:~:text=Why%20is%20it%20important%3F,together%20to%20produce%20great%20results.){:target="_blank"}.
- Establish [“way of working”](https://www.101ways.com/2019/04/03/how-to-develop-a-teams-ways-of-working/#:~:text=Suggested%20ways%20of%20working&text=For%20larger%20teams%2C%20break%20into,one%20way%20of%20doing%20something){:target="_blank"} (sprint cycles, way of communication, meeting regularity).
  - Advertise when you will hold Sprint Planning, Stand-ups, Sprint Reviews and Product/feature Demos.
- Agree on a common [“definition of done”](https://www.boost.co.nz/blog/2019/05/definition-of-done-examples-and-tips){:target="_blank"}.
- Create virtual/physical workspace for the team.
- Set up your development environment.
- [Define initial backlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUYUIj1t10Q){:target="_blank"} of requirements/stories/features.
- Identify the high value user stories based on their needs/challenges formulated as user stories  (Waterfall). Specify acceptance criteria for each story.
- [Specify acceptance criteria](https://rubygarage.org/blog/clear-acceptance-criteria-and-why-its-important#:~:text=Put%20simply%2C%20acceptance%20criteria%20specify,client's%20demands%20and%20prevent%20miscommunication.){:target="_blank"} for each story.
- Review your [Definition of Ready](https://www.scruminc.com/definition-of-ready/){:target="_blank"}.
- Publish your Sprint calendar, key project dates, and team resource vacations.
- Work in the open. Deliver often. Increment continuously.

### Resources
Adopt a set of [Digital Principles and Standards such as these](https://canada-ca.github.io/digital-playbook-guide-numerique/views-vues/single-page-seule/en/digital-standards.html){:target="_blank"}. The [Government of Canada Digital Playbook](https://canada-ca.github.io/digital-playbook-guide-numerique/views-vues/agile/en/agile-use-when.html){:target="_blank"} has a useful tool to help determine if ‘Agile’ is right for your project. For more information on the [BCDevExchange](https://bcdevexchange.org/){:target="_blank"} approach to agile consult the [DevHub](https://devhub-static-test-devhub-test.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/Agile-Delivery-Process/Agile-Delivery-Process){:target="_blank"}. The [US Digital Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play4){:target="_blank"} describes the benefits of adopting an incremental agile approach to digital project development. 

### Tooling to consider
Broad examples include:
- Kanban board
- Task assignment system (Jira)
- Documentation Hub (Confluence)
- Code Repository (GitHub)
- Create a training schedule
- Scrum templates
- Adopt Scrum ceremonies
