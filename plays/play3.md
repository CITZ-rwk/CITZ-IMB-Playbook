## Getting Started to Develop Your Solution
Project success is never guaranteed. Determine your approach to product development in order to correctly fit your resource needs.  Develop your team’s capacity to deliver modern digital solutions by enhancing your existing skillset through exposure to experienced people either using temporary assignments, contractors or co-ops. Once you have your team come to a common understanding of the culture you wish to promote then entrust design and development to the team which you have empowered.

Have a [design system](https://uxdesign.cc/everything-you-need-to-know-about-design-systems-54b109851969) which establishes your product framework based on your priorities and complies with government standards.

### Step 1: Go Agile, don’t repeat the old ways
#### Checklist
- Select [Agile](https://www.seguetech.com/waterfall-vs-agile-methodology/) because:
  - The intended solution is large.
  - The solution can be a collection of many different projects.
  - Working within a Time & Materials contract.
  - Requirements are expected to change over time.
  - Product Owners are embedded in a team and prepare requirements daily.
  - Projects do not have a Project Manager as all team members co-manage the project.
  - Developers have cross-functional skills. 
- Reject the ‘old ways’ (aka: Waterfall) because:
  - The intended solution will be large and has a higher risk for failure.
  - Requirements are expected to change over time.
  - Many waterfall projects are abandoned and do not meet user expectations when finally completed.

### Step 2: Augment your team with experience
#### Checklist

- Discuss the client’s attitude and approach to managing risk and change.
- Agree on a reporting strategy to track and communicate progress to stakeholders.
- Agree on which tools will foster the most productive collaboration.

#### Resources
Adopt a set of [Digital Principles and Standards such as these](https://canada-ca.github.io/digital-playbook-guide-numerique/views-vues/single-page-seule/en/digital-standards.html). The [Government of Canada Digital Playbook](https://canada-ca.github.io/digital-playbook-guide-numerique/views-vues/agile/en/agile-use-when.html) has a useful tool to help determine if ‘Agile’ is right for your project. For more information on the [BCDevExchange](https://bcdevexchange.org/) approach to agile consult the [DevHub](https://devhub-static-test-devhub-test.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/Agile-Delivery-Process/Agile-Delivery-Process). The [US Digital Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play4) describes the benefits of adopting an incremental agile approach to digital project development.
