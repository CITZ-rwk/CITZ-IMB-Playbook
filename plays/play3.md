## Getting Started to Develop Your Solution
Project success is never guaranteed. Determine your approach to product development in order to correctly fit your resource needs.  Develop your team’s capacity to deliver modern digital solutions by enhancing your existing skillset through exposure to experienced people either using temporary assignments, contractors or co-ops. Once you have your team come to a common understanding of the culture you wish to promote then entrust design and development to the team which you have empowered.

    - Product Owners are embedded in a team and prepare requirements daily.
    - Projects do not have a Project Manager as all team members co-manage the project.
    - Developers have cross-functional skills. 
- Select Waterfall when:
    - Software development will be completed as one project
    - Risk Agreements are built into the projects fixed pricing structure.
    - Business Analysts collect requirements before the project starts.
    - Project Manager is a core function to ensure the project follows the development cycle and delivers the expected inputs before the next phase can begin.

### Step 2: Augment Your Team With Experience
#### Checklist
- Identify the roles your project needs.
    - Build up your teams’ capacity by bringing in resources that are seasoned professionals.

- Agree on a reporting strategy to track and communicate progress to stakeholders
- Agree on which tools will foster the most productive collaboration
- What assets are required in order to start delivering products.
- Formulate the project inception agenda 

### Step 4: Sprint 0 Activities and Project Inception 
#### Checklist
- Identify the Scrum Master and Product Owner (if using Agile)
- Have a team agreement session, identify the team’s values. Display prominently.
- Establish “way of working” (sprint cycles, way of communication, meeting regularity)
- Agree on a common “definition of done”.
- Create virtual/physical workspace for the team.
- Set up your development environment.
- Define initial backlog of requirements/stories/features.
- Identify the high value user stories based on their needs/challenges formulated as user stories (Agile) or Use Cases (Waterfall). Specify acceptance criteria for each story.

### Step 5: Prepare to Sprint

#### Resources
Adopt a set of [Digital Principles and Standards such as these](https://canada-ca.github.io/digital-playbook-guide-numerique/views-vues/single-page-seule/en/digital-standards.html). The [Government of Canada Digital Playbook](https://canada-ca.github.io/digital-playbook-guide-numerique/views-vues/agile/en/agile-use-when.html) has a useful tool to help determine if ‘Agile’ is right for your project. For more information on the [BCDevExchange](https://bcdevexchange.org/) approach to agile consult the [DevHub](https://devhub-static-test-devhub-test.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/Agile-Delivery-Process/Agile-Delivery-Process). The [US Digital Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/#play4) describes the benefits of adopting an incremental agile approach to digital project development. 

#### Metrics
Broad examples include:
- Kanban board
- Task assignment system (Jira)
- Documentation Hub (Confluence)
- Code Repository (GitHub)
- Training schedule
