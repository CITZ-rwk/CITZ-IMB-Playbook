## Continuous Product Improvement
In this cycle a team is responsible for a continuous cycle of product enhancement and ongoing support based on incorporating user feedback and operational metrics provided by monitoring.  Continuous Product Improvement is a critical aspect of product Management aimed at improving work practices that focusing on customer value adding tasks and minimizing non-value (defect remediation, partially done work, unnecessary features) activities.  

The work that took you to this play offers many insights and metric that should be reviewed and actioned as part of the overall improvement and change management processes. 

Ensure that team ownership (that was originally defined in [Play 2](/CITZ-IMB-playbook/play2)) has been reviewed and reaffirmed. 
-	Is it within the product business unit?
-	Has it been delegated to the IMB (through an agreement)?
-	Has it been outsourced to an independent services organization?
-	Has an Application/Product Manager role been defined?
-	Who is providing the Business Analyst (BA) services? Are the IMB BA’s involved?

### Step 1: Incorporate Feedback
-	Conduct product reusability analysis at least twice a year
    -	Defer to a product usability expert to run workshops
    -	Aim for incremental deliverables, identify the features users want (unnecessary features result in partially done work)
    -	Review and obtain metrics that can provide product adoption and usage insights 
-	Prioritize feedback

### Step 2: Maintain Product Vision
-	Review the product roadmap with the team and your stakeholders
-	Reaffirm direction
-	Regularly groom the Kanban board 
-	Review user story catalogue, deprecate stories that are no longer valued
-	Strive for better team and stakeholder collaboration.

### Step 3: Conduct process improvement reviews
-	Prioritize type of improvement
    -	Deliberate improvement: make features better that add user value. Focus on small incremental improvements that can be quickly deployed.
    -	Frequency improvement: identify features that would benefit from increased usage. Communicate with the team. Incorporate into the product release plan.
    -	Adoption improvements:  A feature that is core to the product isn’t being used, identify opportunities to recast the feature. This may introduce risk, plan potential solutions.
-	Identify non-valued work (defects, partially done work, unnecessary features, sources of delays), devise strategies to address
-	Seek to improve the sizing of tasks
-	Maintain an ’improvement” backlog.

### Step 4: Prioritize bugs and new feature requests
-	Defects lead to customer dissatisfaction, and reduce team efficiency
    -	aim for a zero defect policy
    -	bugs have higher priority over new feature development
    -	maintain a defect backlog
-	Maintain a ‘root cause registry’ of logged defects/bugs
    -	aim for a zero defect policy
    -	bugs have higher priority over new feature development
    -	maintain a defect backlog

### Step 5: Ongoing Code / Build / Deploy / Release Management
-	Commitment to feature driven development where team pulls tasks from the Kanban board
-	Review your tooling, are there updates or dependencies that impact the supportability of your product? 
-	When was the documentation last reviewed?
-	Utilize application performance monitoring tools to conduct application flow analysis. This will help to show what features users are or are not using.
-	Conduct code reviews to identify partially done work, features that have not been deployed.
-	Review image build times, can they be reduced?
-	Validate release rollback process.

### Step 6: Skills retention requires a plan
-	Reducing “handoffs” is difficult, studies show that after the 4th handoff only 6% of the original knowledge is retained
-	Change is inevitable, ensure you have a succession plan in place for each ‘role’ on your team .
-	Share knowledge .
-	Ask for feedback from other groups.
-	Seek opportunities to invite other interested workers into the team (via ‘Expression of Interest’ Temporary Assignments).
-	Engage University/College Co-op students.
-	Give staff the time to take webinars and other online training.

### Step 7: Communicate your success
-	Measure, celebrate and communicate the team’s workflow throughout the organization through announcements such as newsletters, provide ‘lessons learned’ webinars and presentations and author blogs.

### Guidance to consider:
-	Does your team composition (IS21, IS24, IS27s) still reflect the products’ needs?
-	Does your team have access to Service Design and User Experience (UX) skills as needed?
-	Kanban board guides activities.
-	Incident/Bug Tickets can be assigned.
-	Task assignment system (Jira) is being regularly reviewed.
