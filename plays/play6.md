## Continuous Product Improvement
In this cycle a team is responsible for a continuous cycle of product enhancement and ongoing support based on incorporating user feedback and operational metrics provided by monitoring.  The product owner shifts their role to becoming the “story owner”. 

Ensure that team ownership (that was originally defined in [Play 2](/CITZ-IMB-playbook/play2)) has been reviewed and reaffirmed.
- Is it within the product business unit? 
- Has it been delegated to the IMB (through a MOU agreement)? 
- Has it been outsourced to an independent services organization?
- Has an Application/Product Manager role been defined?
- Who is providing the Business Analyst (BA) services? Are the IMB BA’s involved?

### Step 1: Kanban drives the developers [who add features]

### Step 2: Incorporate Feedback

### Step 3: Prioritize bugs and new feature requests (based on the PO’s decision)

### Step 4: Ongoing Code / Build / Deploy / Release Management

### Step 5: Iteratively improve your processes
- Seek to improve the sizing of tasks.
- Strive for better team and stakeholder collaboration.

### Step 6: Skills retention requires a plan
- Change is inevitable, ensure you have a succession plan in place for each ‘role’ on your team .
- Review your processes, review your documentation.
- Share knowledge .
- Ask for feedback from other groups.
- Seek opportunities to invite other interested workers into the team (via ‘Expression of Interest’ Temporary Assignments).
- Engage University/College Co-op students.
- Give staff the time to take webinars and other online training.

### Step 7: Communicate your success
- Measure, celebrate and communicate the team’s workflow throughout the organization through announcements such as newsletters, provide ‘lessons learned’ webinars and presentations and author blogs.


### Guidance to consider:
-	Does your team composition (IS21, IS24, IS27s)  still reflect the products’ needs?
-	Does your team have access to  Service Design and User Experience (UX) skills as needed?
-	Kanban board guides activities.
-	Incident/Bug Tickets can be assigned.
-	Task assignment system (Jira) is being regularly reviewed.
